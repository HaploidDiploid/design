About this page
==========================

This is the about- page! I'll put some cool and useful info about the whole project and what I do here soon, because don't we all just love cool and useful information?     

Like that thing about the car key. 
If you're standing far away from your car, and the little remote control- clicky- thingy doesn't seem to work because you're out of reach. Have you ever tried putting the key up to your head? Try it, I'm pretty sure it'll work! You put the key up to your head and push the button while you look at your car. It works!  

Anyway, that's not what I was going to write about. I'll make sure to put something better here when I can think of it.
