Error 404
=========

Woops. Looks like this page doesn't exist yet. 
This leaves you with a couple of choices;
1. Get back <a href="%base_url%?">home</a></td> and start all over again.
2. Click on the top right menu to find some other stuff.
3. Click at random at anything you see. Who knows? maybe there's a hidden treasure somewhere?
4. Go to another webpage. I hear <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google </a>is a popular one with the kids these days. 
5. Turn off your browser and do something else. Maybe play a game, read a book, talk to someone, listen to some music or go outside. There are infinite possibilities! Live your life!
