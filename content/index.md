Presentation page
==========================

Hi there! My name is Joacim Holm.    
This is my presentation page, where I try my best to introduce myself and describe my progress in the Design- course.    


So, where should I begin?
It was the *year of the Tiger*, **1986**.     

It hadn't been a great year so far, for Sweden, or the world as a whole, for that matter.   
 * Swedish Prime Minister **Olof Palme** was murdered in february.   
 * The fourth reactor at the **Chernobyl** Nuclear Power Plant in Pripyat, Ukraine, exploded in April, causing what is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.  
 * In January, The Space Shuttle **Challenger** broke apart and exploded, less than two minutes into  its flight.    

...And then, in August, **I** was born.    
Around 34 years later, the text you're reading right now was written.
I'm currently working on understanding SCSS and trying to use markdown for making pretty websites that people can actually use. I love it.

Just look at me, I'm happy as a slinky on an escalator!
